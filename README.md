**Project Duration:** March 2022 to May 2022

## Overview

The "Financial Fraud Detection and Data Optimization" project, conducted from March to May 2022, is aimed at enhancing financial fraud detection and optimizing data processes using the R programming language and machine learning techniques. Through meticulous data wrangling, false positives were reduced by 15%, significantly improving the accuracy of fraud detection. Moreover, the implementation of Random Forest resulted in a remarkable 23% reduction in fraudulent payouts by identifying irregular patterns and anomalies within financial data.

## Key Achievements

- Utilized data wrangling techniques in R to process financial data, resulting in a 15% reduction in false positives and an enhancement in fraud detection accuracy.
- Implemented the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to detect fraudulent activities, achieving a substantial 23% reduction in fraudulent payouts.

## Methodology

### Data Wrangling
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure high data quality and consistency.
- Feature engineering to extract relevant information for fraud detection.

### Machine Learning (Random Forest)
- The Random Forest algorithm was employed to detect fraudulent patterns and anomalies.
- Training and evaluation of the model to achieve optimal performance.

## Outcomes

The project led to significant improvements in fraud detection and reduced the financial burden of fraudulent payouts by 23%. The combination of data wrangling techniques and machine learning algorithms played a pivotal role in achieving these results.
